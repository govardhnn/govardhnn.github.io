    date: 10th February, 2025
    description: A descriptive guide on redesigning the Multi Dimensional Sorting Algorithm (MDSA) implementation in Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV), and performs a comparative study with the Verilog implementation from my B.Tech Capstone Project. This work achieves a 25% reduction in gate-count compared to the legacy Verilog implementation, with one simple optimization.<br>
